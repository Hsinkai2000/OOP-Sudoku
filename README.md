# Sudoku Java Game
## This project implements a classic Sudoku game in Java.

## Getting Started
This section provides instructions on how to run the game.

## Prerequisites:

Java JDK 8 or above (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## Gameplay
The game provides a basic Sudoku experience. You will be presented with a partially filled Sudoku board and will need to use logic to fill in the remaining cells while following the Sudoku rules:

Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Use the number keys (1-9) on your keyboard to enter digits into the cells. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the board. Press Esc to exit the game.

## Additional features (optional):

Implement a difficulty level selection (easy, medium, hard) where the initial board starts with more or less empty cells.
Add a timer to track how long it takes the user to solve the puzzle.
Integrate a hint system that suggests possible values for a selected cell.
